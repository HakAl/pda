  *or* substitute with **3 (6.5 oz) cans of chopped clams** + **1 bottle (8 oz) clam juice**
* **4 oz salt pork** or **thick-cut bacon**, diced
* **1 medium yellow onion**, finely chopped

### üç≥ Instructions:

#### 1. **Prepare the clams**

If using **fresh clams**:

* Place them in a pot with about 1 cup of water, cover, and steam over medium heat until they just open (5‚Äì7 minutes).
* Remove clams, strain and reserve the **clam liquor** (broth) through cheesecloth or a coffee filter to remove sand.
* Chop the clams, discarding any shells and tough parts.

If using **canned clams**:

* Drain and reserve the juice. You‚Äôll need about 2 cups of total clam liquid.

---

#### 2. **Cook the salt pork or bacon**

* In a large soup pot, cook the **salt pork or bacon** over medium heat until the fat is rendered and it's lightly browned.
* Remove the meat bits (optional) and keep the fat in the pot.

---

#### 3. **Saut√© aromatics**

* Add the **onion** (and celery, if using) to the fat and saut√© until translucent, about 5 minutes.

---

#### 4. **Add potatoes and liquid**

* Stir in the **potatoes**, **clam liquor**, and just enough **water** or broth to barely cover the potatoes (about 2‚Äì2.5 cups of liquid total).
* Add a **bay leaf or a pinch of thyme** if using.
* Simmer uncovered until potatoes are tender, \~10‚Äì15 minutes.

---

#### 5. **Thicken (optional)**

* If you want a thicker chowder, make a slurry: whisk **2 tbsp flour** into **2 tbsp of the soup liquid** in a bowl, then stir back into the pot and simmer for a few minutes.

---

#### 6. **Add dairy**

* Stir in the **milk**, **cream**, and **butter** (if using). Warm through **gently** ‚Äî **do not boil** or the dairy might curdle.

---

#### 7. **Add clams**

* Finally, stir in the chopped **clams** and heat just until warmed through (1‚Äì2 minutes). Clams get tough if overcooked.

---

#### 8. **Season and serve**

* Season with **salt and pepper** to taste.
* Let sit for 15‚Äì20 minutes off the heat to let flavors meld, then reheat gently if needed.
* Serve with **oyster crackers** or **rustic bread**.

---

### üìù Notes:

* Traditional chowder was often thickened just by mashing a few potatoes or using a flour-based roux ‚Äî resist over-thickening.
* Older New England recipes sometimes skipped the cream entirely and used just milk or even water with salt pork for a thinner chowder.
* The chowder actually improves after a day in the fridge!
